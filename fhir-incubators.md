# FHIR Incubator IGs Overview

As part of FHIR R6 (v6.0.0), immature resources and operations were moved out of the core specification into "incubator" Implementation Guides for further development. Incubators and their resources are listed below.

\* **Contract** — `StructureDefinition-Contract.xml` was added to `HL7/fm-incubator/input/resources/contract/` on 2026-05-27 (commit `11fee85` by brianpos: "Partial migration of Contract, source is here, but not included in sushi-config.yaml"). It is not yet wired into the IG build and so does not appear on the artifacts page.

\*\* **Contributorship** was added to ebm-incubator on Apr 2, 2026, then removed on 2026-05-19 by brianalperMD (commit `b34f6d0` "removal of Contributorship Additional Resource"). The StructureDefinition and search-params bundle were deleted from the repo. No incubator destination has been assigned.

\*\*\* **InsurancePlan** and **InsuranceProduct** are also still present in the R6 core spec for now; they have been added to admin-incubator preemptively. The R6 ballot4 ballot-intro flags them as "likely to be removed" from core post-ballot, alongside **Invoice**.

‡ New page since the last compilation — covers operations for Groups/Lists in large resources.

## Notes for the FHIR Management Group (R6 transition)

<details>
<summary>Still in R6 core, awaiting final incubator destination</summary>

- **InsurancePlan**, **InsuranceProduct** — present in both R6 core and `admin-incubator`. The dual-listing should be resolved at R6 ballot4 disposition: either remove from core (preferred per the ballot intro) or remove from `admin-incubator`. Plan also calls for these to move from `admin-incubator` to `fm-incubator`.
- **Invoice** — currently in `fm-incubator` but the R6 ballot4 ballot-intro flags it as "likely to be removed" from core post-ballot. Confirm core removal.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Removed from build with no incubator home</summary>

- **Contributorship** — removed from `ebm-incubator` on 2026-05-19 (`b34f6d0`, brianalperMD). If Clinical Decision Support / EBMonFHIR still wants this resource, FMG should confirm the deprioritisation or identify a new owner; otherwise drop it from any "incubated" tracking entirely.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Partially migrated (source in repo, not in build)</summary>

- **fm-incubator / Contract** — `StructureDefinition-Contract.xml` plus examples, search params, code systems, and value sets landed in `HL7/fm-incubator/input/resources/contract/` on 2026-05-27 (commit `11fee85`). The author's own commit message notes it is "not included in sushi-config.yaml", so the artifact is invisible in the build. Confirm intended owner and finish wiring it in.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Missing content</summary>

- **api-incubator-ig** — `DocumentReference $generate` and `SpecimenDefinition $apply` are noted as belonging here, but neither has been authored yet.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Untracked capstmt artifacts</summary>

- **feature** (extension) and **FeatureDefinition** (logical model) are published by `capstmt` but were not previously listed on the overview page. FMG should confirm these belong to the incubator scope. (Other new artifacts that show up in incubators are fine — that is the purpose of incubators. Only artifacts already present in the build are tracked above.)
</details>

<details>
<summary>Sample / template repos</summary>

- **HL7/sample-incubator-ig** is a template/sample repository (created 2025-11-06), not a working incubator. It is excluded from the summary tables.
</details>
