# FHIR Incubator IGs Overview

As part of FHIR R6 (v6.0.0), immature resources and operations were moved out of the core specification into "incubator" Implementation Guides for further development. Incubators and their resources are listed below.

\* Contributorship was added to ebm-incubator on Apr 2, 2026, then removed on 2026-05-19 by brianalperMD - the StructureDefinition and search-params bundle were deleted from the repo. No incubator destination has been assigned.

\** Invoice is flagged in the R6 ballot4 ballot-intro as "likely to be removed" from core post-ballot, alongside InsurancePlan and InsuranceProduct. Invoice has been added to fm-incubator (2026-05-27+); InsurancePlan/InsuranceProduct remain in admin-incubator only.

\*** InsurancePlan and InsuranceProduct are also still present in the R6 core spec for now; they have been added to admin-incubator preemptively. fm-incubator exists but does not yet host them.

\**** PublicationRecord is present in ebm-incubator in place of Citation. This appears to be a rename/replacement of the Citation resource; needs confirmation from the CDS WG.

## Notes for the FHIR Management Group (R6 transition)

<details>
<summary>Show details</summary>

**Still in R6 core, awaiting final incubator destination:**
- InsurancePlan and InsuranceProduct — remain in R6 core; also preemptively hosted in admin-incubator. FMG expectation is that these move to fm-incubator once it accepts them.
- Invoice — flagged in the R6 ballot4 ballot-intro as "likely to be removed" from core post-ballot; already available in fm-incubator.

**Removed from build with no incubator home:**
- Contributorship — deleted from ebm-incubator on 2026-05-19 by brianalperMD; the StructureDefinition and search-params bundle are gone from the repo. No new incubator destination has been assigned. FMG action: decide whether Contributorship stays retired or is re-homed.
- Citation — no longer appears as a StructureDefinition in ebm-incubator. It has apparently been replaced/renamed to PublicationRecord (see next section). If Citation is intentionally retired, the release-notes/history should record the rename.

**Renamed/replaced content (needs FMG confirmation):**
- **Citation → PublicationRecord** in ebm-incubator. `StructureDefinition-Citation.html` is no longer built; `StructureDefinition-PublicationRecord.html` is now published in its place, with a full set of search parameters, examples, and lists. If this is a rename, the FMG should track that R6 core references to Citation need pointer updates.

**In repo but not yet in build (partial migration):**
- Contract — present in fm-incubator repo but has not yet appeared in the built artifacts page. Needs a fresh build to expose it, or migration is incomplete.

**Missing content (planned, but not yet in build):**
- api-incubator-ig: `DocumentReference $generate` and `SpecimenDefinition $apply` are still listed as planned operations but have no built OperationDefinition. Owners should either produce the operations or drop them from the roadmap.
- fm-incubator: only 3 of ~8 planned Financial Management resources are in the build. The remaining ~5 (e.g., Coverage/ExplanationOfBenefit/Claim family per the FM WG roadmap) still need migration.

**Untracked capstmt artifacts:**
- FeatureDefinition is a **logical model** (kind=logical) — it is neither a resource nor a profile, and today it lives in capstmt without a matching entry in the R6 core registry. Present in build; new artifacts in incubators are expected and fine — no action needed unless FMG wants a formal registry entry.

**Cross-check — resources still expected in incubators but not seen:**
- No new incubator repos beyond the 13 listed above appear on the HL7 GitHub org (`*incubator*` search). `sample-incubator-ig` is present but is an example template, not a live incubator.
