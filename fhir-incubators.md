# FHIR Incubator IGs Overview

As part of FHIR R6 (v6.0.0), immature resources and operations were moved out of the core specification into "incubator" Implementation Guides for further development. Incubators and their resources are listed below.

\* **Citation** was present in ebm-incubator as of 2026-07-17 but is no longer in the build as of this report (returns HTTP 404). It has been replaced by **PublicationRecord**. The transition appears intentional per EBM Workgroup activity in October 2026 (repo updated 2026-10-22).

\*\* **Contributorship** was added to ebm-incubator on Apr 2, 2026, then removed on 2026-05-19 by brianalperMD — the StructureDefinition and search-params bundle were deleted from the repo. No incubator destination has been assigned.

\*\*\* **InsurancePlan** and **InsuranceProduct** are also still present in the R6 core spec; they have been added to admin-incubator preemptively. fm-incubator exists but does not yet host them.

\*\*\*\* **Invoice** is flagged in the R6 ballot4 ballot-intro as "likely to be removed" from core post-ballot, alongside InsurancePlan and InsuranceProduct. Invoice has been added to fm-incubator (2026-05-27+); InsurancePlan/InsuranceProduct remain in admin-incubator only.

## Notes for the FHIR Management Group (R6 transition)

<details>
<summary>Show details</summary>

**Still in R6 core, awaiting final incubator destination:**
- **InsurancePlan** — present in R6 core spec AND in admin-incubator. Expected to move to fm-incubator, but fm-incubator does not yet host it.
- **InsuranceProduct** — present in R6 core spec AND in admin-incubator. Expected to move to fm-incubator, but fm-incubator does not yet host it.
- **Invoice** — flagged in R6 ballot4 as "likely to be removed" from core post-ballot. Already present in fm-incubator (added 2026-05-27+). Needs final removal from core.

**Removed from build with no incubator home:**
- **Contributorship** — was added to ebm-incubator Apr 2, 2026, removed 2026-05-19. No destination assigned. Still a gap.
- **Citation** — present in ebm-incubator as of 2026-07-17, no longer in build as of 2026-10-23 (HTTP 404). Replaced by **PublicationRecord** in ebm-incubator. If Citation was intentionally retired, confirm transition path for existing consumers of Citation; if not intentional, this is a regression.

**Missing content (operations referenced by current page but still 404 in build):**
- **DocumentReference $generate** — slated for api-incubator-ig, build returns 404.
- **SpecimenDefinition $apply** — slated for api-incubator-ig, build returns 404.
- **Contract** — slated for fm-incubator but still "in repo, not in build" (partial migration).

**fm-incubator incomplete:**
- Current scope is 3 resources (EnrollmentRequest, EnrollmentResponse, Invoice) out of ~8 planned. Missing: Contract (partial), InsurancePlan, InsuranceProduct, and (per prior plans) additional FM resources.

**Untracked capstmt artifacts:**
- `FeatureDefinition` (logical model, kind=logical) is published by capstmt but is neither a FHIR resource nor a profile; it is not counted in resource/profile totals. New artifacts added to incubators are the expected pattern — this is listed only so FMG is aware of what capstmt now publishes.

**New since 2026-07-17 (changes since the current Confluence page):**
- **ebm-incubator**: Citation removed from build; PublicationRecord added as the sole resource.
- **data-access-policies**: 4 new profiles on Permission added — K-anonymity, from-consent, imposed-on-bundle, rule-expression.

**All builds green** — all 13 incubator IGs' build.fhir.org CI builds return HTTP 200 and have no missing resource/operation pages beyond those enumerated above.
