# FHIR Incubator IGs Overview

As part of FHIR R6 (v6.0.0), immature resources and operations were moved out of the core specification into "incubator" Implementation Guides for further development. Incubators and their resources are listed below.

\* Invoice is flagged in the R6 ballot4 ballot-intro as "likely to be removed" from core post-ballot, alongside InsurancePlan and InsuranceProduct. No incubator destination has been assigned yet.

\*\* InsurancePlan and InsuranceProduct are also still present in the R6 core spec for now; they have been added to admin-incubator preemptively.

Note: the previous Confluence page listed `Contributorship` as "pending" in ebm-incubator (with a note about an Apr 2, 2026 commit). Verified 2026-05-22: no `Contributorship` StructureDefinition exists in the ebm-incubator repository, and `sushi-config.yaml` only references `input/resources/citation`. Removed from this report.

Note: capstmt also publishes a logical model `FeatureDefinition` and an extension definition `feature` — not listed here as they are not resource profiles.

## Discrepancies vs prior Confluence page (compiled 2026-05-18)

- **txmodule-incubator** — Confluence showed "REPO CREATED (EMPTY), NO BUILD" with 0 resources/operations. Reality: a working CI build is now live with **2 OperationDefinitions** (`CodeSystem $find-matches`, `ConceptMap $closure`). Work group: Terminology Infrastructure. *(Status change: NO BUILD → OK.)*
- **ebm-incubator** — Confluence claimed Contributorship was added on Apr 2, 2026 and "pending" in build (count `1 (+1 pending)`). Verification finds **no Contributorship file** anywhere in the repo, and `sushi-config.yaml` only references `input/resources/citation`. Corrected count to **1 resource**.
- **api-incubator-ig** — Confluence listed **12 operations**. Only **4** are currently present in the repository (`List-find`, `Resource-large-resource-{add,filter,remove}`). The other 8 ($graph, $meta, $meta-add, $meta-delete, DocumentReference $generate, SpecimenDefinition $apply, async bulk data, async bundle) are not in the repo. Listed separately as "planned". Note: the repo's `sushi-config.yaml` still carries the wrong `id` (`hl7.fhir.uv.symptoms`) which is part of why the build fails.
- **capstmt** — also publishes a logical model (`FeatureDefinition`) and extension (`feature`) the Confluence page didn't mention. Not material to counts but noted.
- **HL7 GitHub** — incubator-name search surfaced `sample-incubator-ig` (a template/skeleton, not a real incubator); `phx-incubator` confirmed not yet created.
- **Confluence access** — `confluence.hl7.org/rest/api/content/441128732` is now served behind AWS WAF human-verification for non-browser clients; both the REST API and HTML are 403/redirected for agents.
