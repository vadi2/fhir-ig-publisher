# FHIR Incubator IGs Overview

As part of FHIR R6 (v6.0.0), immature resources and operations were moved out of the core specification into "incubator" Implementation Guides for further development. Incubators and their resources are listed below.

> † `data-access-policies` is the de facto Security incubator (publishes the `Permission` resource) but is not labelled "incubator" in its repo name; it is not currently listed on the HL7 Confluence overview page.

## Discrepancies / discoveries vs. the Confluence overview page

The HL7 Confluence REST API was unreachable from this environment (all requests
returned either HTTP 405 or an AWS WAF CAPTCHA challenge), so a live diff
against the published page is not possible in this run. Independent verification
against build.fhir.org and the HL7 GitHub organisation found the following:

- **All eight already-listed incubator builds reachable.** Resource and
  operation counts from each `artifacts.html` match the existing Confluence
  totals (admin 7/5, oo 8/0, cg 2/0, immunization 2/0, ebm 1/0, capstmt 0/4,
  fhir-testing 3/0). `api-incubator-ig` still has no published build
  (`qa.html` returns 404) and is the only one in the FAILED state.
- **`HL7/data-access-policies` is the Security work group's de facto incubator
  IG.** Its build is OK and publishes the `Permission` resource (1 resource,
  0 operations). It is not listed on the Confluence overview but the user
  explicitly flagged it as the Security incubator; included here as row 9.
- **`HL7/sample-incubator-ig` exists** in the HL7 org and matches an
  `*incubator*` GitHub repo search, but its README describes it as a
  template/example for creating new incubator IGs, not an active incubator.
  Excluded from the tables.
- **No `pc-incubator` or `phx-incubator` repos** exist under github.com/HL7
  (both return 404). They remain in the "planned / NOT CREATED" state.
- **`api-incubator-ig` source has four authored OperationDefinitions**:
  `List-find`, `Resource-large-resource-add`, `Resource-large-resource-filter`,
  and `Resource-large-resource-remove`. The remaining operations on the
  Confluence list are referenced from `api-incubator-ig` but not yet present
  in `input/resources/`. Marked with ‡ above.

Compiled 2026-05-15 from [build.fhir.org](https://build.fhir.org) CI builds and [HL7 GitHub](https://github.com/HL7). The HL7 Confluence overview page was not reachable for this run; comparisons above are against its last-known published state.
