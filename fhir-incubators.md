# FHIR Incubator IGs Overview

As part of FHIR R6 (v6.0.0), immature resources and operations were moved out of the core specification into "incubator" Implementation Guides for further development. Incubators and their resources are listed below.

## Changes since 2026-05-15

- **pc-incubator repo CREATED.** The previous report recorded pc-incubator
  as "remain uncreated". The repo [HL7/pc-incubator](https://github.com/HL7/pc-incubator)
  now exists (last push 2026-05-18) but is an **empty placeholder** — no
  `sushi-config.yaml`, no `input/`, no content — and there is no CI build
  (`build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/pc-incubator/` → 404). Summary status changed
  from "NOT CREATED" to "REPO CREATED (EMPTY), NO BUILD". Planned
  resources (ClinicalAssessment, ConditionDefinition, Linkage) still not built.
- **data-access-policies (Security incubator) now tracked.** Added as
  row 9. [HL7/data-access-policies](https://github.com/HL7/data-access-policies)
  is the Security WG incubator (not named "*incubator*"); it builds OK and
  contributes the `Permission` resource. Verified against the live CI
  package `.index.json`.
- **sample-incubator-ig discovered.** [HL7/sample-incubator-ig](https://github.com/HL7/sample-incubator-ig)
  exists and builds, but it is an example/template IG with **0 resources
  and 0 operations**. Treated as a sample, not a true incubator, and
  excluded from the summary count.
- **Profiles broken out.** Added an "All incubated profiles" section
  (`medicalproductofhumanorigin`, `shareabletestscript`, and capstmt's
  three feature-query profiles) — previously only mentioned in notes.

## Discrepancies and notes

- **Confluence page inaccessible**: The HL7 Confluence REST API (both the
  content endpoint `…/rest/api/content/441128732` and the search endpoint
  `…/rest/api/search`) is behind an AWS WAF/CAPTCHA challenge — every
  request returns HTTP 405 with `x-amzn-waf-action: captcha`, and no
  Wayback Machine snapshot exists. The Confluence "search FHIR space for
  incubator pages" step could not be performed. This report is compiled
  independently from build.fhir.org CI builds and HL7 GitHub.
- **GitHub repo scan**: HL7 org `*incubator*` search returned oo-, cg-,
  admin-, pc-, ebm-, immunization-, sample-incubator-ig and api-incubator-ig.
  No previously-unknown active incubator repos beyond pc-incubator (new,
  empty) and sample-incubator-ig (example IG).
- **FHIR R6 ballot4**: The spec has progressed from ballot3 to ballot4
  (May 2026). All incubator IG configs still reference ballot3.
- **New resource (Contributorship)**: Added to ebm-incubator repo on
  Apr 2, 2026. Still not rendering in CI build as of 2026-05-18.
- **Invoice flagged**: R6 ballot4 ballot-intro notes Invoice is "likely
  to be removed" from core post-ballot. No incubator assigned yet.
- **oo-incubator active**: MedicalProductOfHumanOrigin profile (on
  BiologicallyDerivedProduct; not a new resource type) present. Ongoing
  cleanup of search params and examples.
- **api-incubator-ig misconfigured**: build still FAILED — `package.tgz`
  is 0 bytes and `qa.html` returns 404. `sushi-config.yaml` ID is
  `hl7.fhir.uv.symptoms` (should be api-related), causing build failure
  since Nov 2025. No commits since creation. Resource/operation counts
  retained from prior enumeration since artifacts cannot be regenerated.
- **QA validation errors**: All built IGs except capstmt have QA
  validation errors, primarily R6/R5 dependency version mismatches.
  Builds complete and pages are accessible despite errors.
- **phx-incubator**: still no GitHub repo and no build; remains
  "NOT CREATED (planned)".
