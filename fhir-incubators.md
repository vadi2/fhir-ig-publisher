# FHIR Incubator IGs Overview

As part of FHIR R6 (v6.0.0), immature resources and operations were moved out of the core specification into "incubator" Implementation Guides for further development. Incubators and their resources are listed below.

&lowast; Contributorship was added to ebm-incubator on Apr 2, 2026, then removed on 2026-05-19 by brianalperMD (commit `b34f6d0`, "removal of Contributorship Additional Resource") — the StructureDefinition and search-params bundle were deleted from the repo. No incubator destination has been assigned.

&lowast;&lowast; Invoice is flagged in the R6 ballot4 ballot-intro as "likely to be removed" from core post-ballot, alongside InsurancePlan and InsuranceProduct. Invoice has been added to fm-incubator (2026-05-27+); InsurancePlan/InsuranceProduct remain in admin-incubator only.

&lowast;&lowast;&lowast; InsurancePlan and InsuranceProduct no longer appear in the R6 core resource list (v6.0.0-ballot4); admin-incubator is currently their sole publication home until fm-incubator adopts them.

## Notes for the FHIR Management Group (R6 transition)

<details>
<summary>Show details</summary>

**Still in R6 core, awaiting final incubator destination:**

- None identified this pass. Spot-checks against `build.fhir.org/resourcelist.html` (v6.0.0-ballot4) confirm that every resource listed in this overview — ChargeItem, ChargeItemDefinition, InsurancePlan, InsuranceProduct, Invoice, Contract, EnrollmentRequest, EnrollmentResponse, Permission, Citation, ClinicalAssessment, Linkage, ConditionDefinition, FormularyItem, ImmunizationEvaluation, ImmunizationRecommendation, GenomicStudy, MolecularDefinition, BiologicallyDerivedProductDispense, DeviceDispense, DeviceUsage, InventoryItem, InventoryReport, SupplyDelivery, SupplyRequest, Transport, TestPlan, TestReport, TestScript, GraphDefinition, EncounterHistory, PersonalRelationship, VerificationResult, Contributorship — is absent from the R6 core resource index. Core is clean.

**Removed from build with no incubator home:**

- **Contributorship** — Deleted from ebm-incubator on 2026-05-19 (commit `b34f6d0`, "removal of Contributorship Additional Resource" by brianalperMD). No other incubator has picked it up. If continued work is intended, FMG needs to assign a destination IG or formally retire the resource.

**Partial migration (in repo but not in build):**

- **Contract** — `HL7/fm-incubator/input/resources/contract/` holds a full Contract package (`StructureDefinition-Contract.xml`, 23 code systems, 30+ value sets, examples, search-param bundle — 60+ files) but Contract does not surface on the fm-incubator artifacts page. The fm-incubator build currently only publishes EnrollmentRequest, EnrollmentResponse, and Invoice. Contract needs to be wired into the IG's sushi/publish config to appear.

**Cross-IG migration in progress:**

- **InsurancePlan / InsuranceProduct** — Currently published only from admin-incubator. Both are expected to move to fm-incubator once FM adopts them. Coordinate the eventual deletion from admin-incubator with the addition to fm-incubator so there is no gap and no double-publication.
- **Invoice** — Now published from fm-incubator (added post-2026-05-27) and is no longer in R6 core. Confirm it is not simultaneously listed anywhere else.

**Missing content:**

- **api-incubator-ig** — Advertises `DocumentReference $generate` and `SpecimenDefinition $apply` as part of its planned operation set but neither OperationDefinition is present in the build. The artifacts page enumerates 8 operations; 2 planned operations remain unpublished.

**Untracked artifacts (present in build, informational only — new artifacts in incubators are the whole point of incubators):**

- **capstmt / FeatureDefinition** — Published as a logical model (kind=logical). Logical models are outside the resource/profile taxonomy of this overview but are a legitimate incubator artifact — no action required.
- **sample-incubator-ig** (`HL7/sample-incubator-ig`) — Present in HL7 org with a live continuous build. Content is placeholder / template ("Base Page — update as needed", "Plain Language Summary goes here"), labelled Public Health. Not a working-content incubator; excluded from all tables above. FMG may want to decide whether this belongs in HL7 org or in a template repo to avoid confusion.

**Changes vs. prior compilation (2026-07-17 → 2026-07-24):**

- No new incubator repositories in HL7 org.
- No new/removed resources, profiles, or operations across any incubator.
- No build status regressions — all 13 incubators build cleanly.
- Only material commit activity: oo-incubator PR #10 merged 2026-07-02 (MPHO profile set to trial use, README update, `medicalproductofhumanorigin` profile URL scoped to incubator rather than core). Non-structural.
