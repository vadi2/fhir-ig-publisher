# FHIR Incubator IGs Overview

As part of FHIR R6 (v6.0.0), immature resources and operations were moved out of the core specification into "incubator" Implementation Guides for further development. Incubators and their resources are listed below.

## Changes since the last compile (Confluence page dated 2026-05-19)

- **New incubator — [fm-incubator](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fm-incubator/) (Financial Management)**, not on the Confluence page. Builds OK with 3 resources: EnrollmentRequest, EnrollmentResponse, Invoice.
- **Invoice now has a home.** Previously "TBD — FLAGGED FOR REMOVAL" with no destination; now incubated in fm-incubator.
- **api-incubator-ig build fixed: FAILED → OK** (last built 2026-05-28). GraphDefinition and its operations now render. Operation count revised **12 → 8**: `DocumentReference $generate` and `SpecimenDefinition $apply` are no longer present, and "Asynchronous Bulk Data Request" / "Asynchronous Bundle Request" are narrative pages (`async-bulk.html`, `async-bundle.html`), not formal OperationDefinitions.
- **pc-incubator now builds: "REPO CREATED (EMPTY), NO BUILD" → OK** (built 2026-05-28). All 3 planned resources present (ClinicalAssessment, ConditionDefinition, Linkage).
- **phx-incubator now exists and builds: "NOT CREATED" → OK** (built 2026-05-27). FormularyItem present.
- **ebm-incubator:** Contributorship still pending (in repo, not yet in CI build) — unchanged.
- **Profiles:** no change — same 5 profiles as before.
- The HL7 org scan also surfaced **[HL7/sample-incubator-ig](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/sample-incubator-ig/)** — a template/example IG ("Example IG for additional resources") with no resources or operations; excluded from the tables above.

## FHIR Management Group — transition status (core ↔ incubators)

_Method: diff of the [R5](https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/resourcelist.html) vs [R6 build](https://build.fhir.org/resourcelist.html) core resource lists, cross-checked against incubator CI builds._

**Still in BOTH R6 core and an incubator (dual-listed — pending removal from core):**

| Resource | Also incubated in | Note |
|----------|-------------------|------|
| InsurancePlan | admin-incubator | still in R6 core |
| InsuranceProduct | admin-incubator | new R6 core resource, also in incubator |
| Invoice | fm-incubator | still in R6 core |
| EnrollmentRequest | fm-incubator | still in R6 core |
| EnrollmentResponse | fm-incubator | still in R6 core |

These five need to be removed from core (or the duplication otherwise resolved) before R6 is published.

**Removed from R6 core but NOT yet in any incubator — need a destination:**

| Resource | R5 Work Group | Status |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| EvidenceReport | Clinical Decision Support (EBM) | Orphan — ebm-incubator only has Citation (+ pending Contributorship) |
| MedicationKnowledge | Pharmacy | Orphan — phx-incubator only has FormularyItem |
| SubstanceNucleicAcid | BR&R | Orphan — no incubator created |
| SubstancePolymer | BR&R | Orphan — no incubator created |
| SubstanceProtein | BR&R | Orphan — no incubator created |
| SubstanceReferenceInformation | BR&R | Orphan — no incubator created |
| SubstanceSourceMaterial | BR&R | Orphan — no incubator created |

**Renamed / superseded (removed from core, continuing under a new name in an incubator):**

- ClinicalImpression → **ClinicalAssessment** (pc-incubator)
- MolecularSequence → **MolecularDefinition** (cg-incubator)

**Pending in repo, not yet in any CI build:**

- Contributorship (ebm-incubator) — StructureDefinition + search parameters committed, not yet in build output.

**New in R6 core (informational, not an incubator concern):**

- DeviceAlert — new resource added directly to R6 core.
