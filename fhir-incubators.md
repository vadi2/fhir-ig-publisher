# FHIR Incubator IGs Overview

As part of FHIR R6 (v6.0.0), immature resources and operations were moved out of the core specification into "incubator" Implementation Guides for further development. Incubators and their resources are listed below.

> \* **Contributorship** was added to ebm-incubator on Apr 2, 2026 ([commit history](https://github.com/HL7/ebm-incubator/commits/main)). The StructureDefinition and search parameters are in the repo but the resource still does not appear in the CI build output (verified still pending as of 2026-05-19).
>
> \*\* **Invoice** is flagged in the [R6 ballot4 ballot-intro](https://build.fhir.org/ballot-intro.html) as "likely to be removed" from core post-ballot, alongside InsurancePlan and InsuranceProduct. No incubator destination has been assigned yet.
>
> \*\*\* InsurancePlan and InsuranceProduct are also still present in the R6 core spec for now; they have been added to admin-incubator preemptively.

## All incubated profiles

| Profile | Incubator IG | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| [medicalproductofhumanorigin](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/oo-incubator/en/StructureDefinition-medicalproductofhumanorigin.html) (on BiologicallyDerivedProduct) | [oo-incubator](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/oo-incubator/en/) | OK |
| [shareabletestscript](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-testing-ig/en/StructureDefinition-shareabletestscript.html) (on TestScript) | [fhir-testing-ig](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-testing-ig/en/) | OK |
| [FeatureCapabilityStatement](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/capstmt/StructureDefinition-FeatureCapabilityStatement.html) (on CapabilityStatement) | [capstmt](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/capstmt/) | OK |
| [FeatureQueryInputParameters](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/capstmt/StructureDefinition-FeatureQueryInputParameters.html) (on Parameters) | [capstmt](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/capstmt/) | OK |
| [FeatureQueryOutputParameters](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/capstmt/StructureDefinition-FeatureQueryOutputParameters.html) (on Parameters) | [capstmt](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/capstmt/) | OK |

> Verified independently: admin-incubator, cg-incubator, immunization-incubator, ebm-incubator, data-access-policies, and txmodule-incubator have **no** `Structures: Resource Profiles` section in their CI builds, so the five profiles above are the complete set across all building incubator IGs. (capstmt also defines a `FeatureDefinition` logical model, not listed here as a profile.)

## Changes since last compiled page (2026-05-18 → 2026-05-19)

- **txmodule-incubator (Terminology Infrastructure) — NOW BUILDING.** Previously listed as "TBD (planned), 0 ops, REPO CREATED (EMPTY), NO BUILD". The repo now has content and a working CI build at <https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/txmodule-incubator/> (HTTP 200, build OK). It publishes **2 operations** and **0 resources**:
  - `ConceptMap $closure` (Closure Table Maintenance)
  - `CodeSystem $find-matches` (Finding codes based on supplied properties)
- All other IGs, resources, profiles, and operations are unchanged from the prior page.

### Verification notes / discrepancies

- **Confluence inaccessible**: Confluence page 441128732 and the Confluence REST search API are both behind an AWS WAF CAPTCHA challenge for automated agents. The prior page content supplied in the task (compiled 2026-05-18) was used as the comparison baseline.
- **api-incubator-ig** build is still FAILED (`/en/artifacts.html` returns empty). The 1 resource (GraphDefinition) and 12 operations are retained from the prior page / repo, not from a successful build.
- **ebm-incubator**: Contributorship StructureDefinition is in the repo but still NOT in the CI build output as of 2026-05-19 — status remains PENDING (consistent with prior page).
- **pc-incubator**: repo exists but is empty (no commits / no HEAD); build.fhir.org returns 404 — consistent with "REPO CREATED (EMPTY), NO BUILD".
- **phx-incubator**: still does not exist under github.com/HL7; build.fhir.org returns 404 — consistent with "NOT CREATED".
- **HL7/sample-incubator-ig** exists on GitHub ("Example IG for additional resources") but is a template/sample, not a real work-group incubator — intentionally not listed.
- No new incubator repositories were found in the HL7 GitHub org beyond those tracked above.
