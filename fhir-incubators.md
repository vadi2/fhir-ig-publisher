# FHIR Incubator IGs Overview

As part of FHIR R6 (v6.0.0), immature resources and operations were moved out of the core specification into "incubator" Implementation Guides for further development. Incubators and their resources are listed below.

\* Contributorship was added to ebm-incubator on Apr 2, 2026, then removed on 2026-05-19 by @brianalperMD — the StructureDefinition and search-params bundle were deleted from the repo. Still no incubator destination assigned.

\*\* PublicationRecord was added to ebm-incubator around Aug 5, 2026 (by @Khalid-Shahin and @brianalperMD). It replaces Citation in ebm-incubator's build: Citation no longer appears in either R6 core or in ebm-incubator. PublicationRecord's own model references citations via `relatesTo.citation`.

## Notes for the FHIR Management Group (R6 transition)

<details><summary>Show details</summary>

**Still in R6 core, awaiting final incubator destination:**
- None identified. Every resource previously flagged as pending is now either in an incubator or has been removed from FHIR entirely. In particular, **InsurancePlan and InsuranceProduct have now been removed from the R6 core resource list** (previously still in R6 core "for now" as of the July snapshot). They currently live only in `admin-incubator` and are still expected to move to `fm-incubator`; no move commits have landed there yet.

**Removed from build with no incubator home:**
- **Contributorship** — added to ebm-incubator on 2026-04-02, deleted on 2026-05-19 by @brianalperMD (StructureDefinition + search-params bundle removed). No incubator destination has been assigned. Unchanged since prior report.
- **Citation** — no longer appears in either the R6 core resource list or in ebm-incubator (ebm-incubator now hosts PublicationRecord instead, added Aug 5 2026). Please confirm intended fate: silent retirement, rename to PublicationRecord, or move to another incubator. PublicationRecord's model still references citations via `relatesTo.citation`, suggesting the two are related but not equivalent.

**Missing content:**
- `DocumentReference $generate` and `SpecimenDefinition $apply` remain planned in api-incubator-ig but have not yet been published to the CI build. Same status as prior report.
- fm-incubator repo carries a `contract` folder under `input/resources` but Contract has not made it into the CI build. Partial migration; unchanged.

**Sample / template repos:**
- `HL7/sample-incubator-ig` (last updated 2025-11-09) is the reference template for creating new incubator IGs, per its README. Not included in the summary tables above.

**Untracked capstmt artifacts:**
- The capstmt CI build publishes `Binary/FeatureSupport`, the `processing-status-vs` ValueSet, and the `processing-status-cs` CodeSystem alongside the tracked profiles/extension/logical model. These are legitimate new artifacts in an incubator — flagged only so FMG knows they are present and untracked in this overview.

**Incubator repo inventory on HL7 GitHub (as of 2026-09-04):**
- Repos matching `*incubator*` on github.com/HL7 (11): admin-incubator, api-incubator-ig, cg-incubator, ebm-incubator, fm-incubator, immunization-incubator, oo-incubator, pc-incubator, phx-incubator, sample-incubator-ig, txmodule-incubator.
- Additionally treated as incubators (name doesn't include "incubator"): capstmt, fhir-testing-ig, data-access-policies (security incubator).
- No new incubator repositories have appeared since the prior report.
